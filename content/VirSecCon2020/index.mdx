Every year at Oktane, we look forward to bringing together thousands of IT professionals, product leaders, and developers to discuss the importance of identity. As we’ve followed the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it became clear that, this year, the best way to safely engage with our community is through a unique digital conference experience.   

Our vision is to enable any organization to use any technology, and we’re applying that focus to Oktane Live: we’ll leverage the best technology to deliver an innovative, virtual attendee experience. Oktane Live will offer our keynotes, dozens of breakout sessions, and ancillary programs online, and will give attendees the opportunity to interact with sponsors virtually as well. The virtual event will be available to anyone, free of charge. Current registered attendees will receive a full conference refund. Pre-conference Training and Certification registrants will be contacted by our Education Services team about learning and testing enrollment options.   

Replacing the in-person event with dynamic video content will enable us to bring our customers, partners, and employees together in a healthy and productive way. We look forward to sharing our vision, product innovations, and latest customer journeys with you online the week of March 30.
