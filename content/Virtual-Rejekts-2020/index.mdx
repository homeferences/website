In light of the recent challenging events around the globe concerning the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and the postponement of KubeCon EU, the Cloud Native Rejekts organizing team has thought hard about how to support our grass-roots community of proud Rejekts. We are pleased to announce the communityâ€™s first-ever remote alternative event, Virtual Rejekts 2020!
